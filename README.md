## 🔌 API Endpoints

The Express server provides the following RESTful endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|

| GET | `/user/:id` | Returns specific user by ID |
| GET | `/photosOfUser/:id` | Returns all photos for a user with comments |

### Example API Response:

**GET /user/1**

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
- **React 18.2** - UI library
- **React Router 6** - Client-side routing
- **Material-UI 5** - Component library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Emotion** - CSS-in-JS styling

### Backend Technologies
- **Express 4.18** - Web server framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **XMLHttpRequest over Fetch**
   - Educational requirement to understand low-level AJAX
   - Promise-based wrapper for modern async/await usage

2. **Vite over Create React App**
   - Faster development server
   - Better build performance
   - More flexible configuration

3. **Material-UI v5**
   - Comprehensive component library
   - Built-in theming
   - Excellent TypeScript support (for future)

4. **MVC Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable components
   - Easy to test and maintain

## ✅ Code Quality

### ESLint Configuration
- React recommended rules
- React Hooks rules
- Custom rules for code consistency
- Automatic fixing available

### Zero Lint Errors
Run `npm run lint` to verify:
```bash
npm run lint
# ✅ All files pass linting
```

### Code Style
- Consistent component structure
- Proper PropTypes (or TypeScript for future)
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Graceful error handling

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ All users load in sidebar
- ✅ Clicking user navigates to detail page
- ✅ User detail shows all information
- ✅ "View Photos" button navigates to gallery
- ✅ Photos display correctly with fallbacks
- ✅ Comments show with clickable usernames
- ✅ TopBar context updates on navigation
- ✅ Version number displays correctly
- ✅ Deep linking works (refresh on any page)
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Loading states show while fetching
- ✅ Error states handle failures gracefully
